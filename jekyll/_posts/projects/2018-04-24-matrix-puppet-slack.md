# {{ page.title }}
This is an unofficial matrix slack bridge that works by means of [user puppetting](https://github.com/AndrewJDR/matrix-puppet-bridge).

Get your `user_access_token` from here:

https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens

The bridge uses that access token to connect as a client using the slack RTM API.

This technique does not require admin on the slack team; instead, the bridge is simply a custom slack client.

The bridge supports multiple teams at once, see the config.sample.json
