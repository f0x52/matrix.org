# Riot.im Cookie Policy

This is the Cookie Policy for the Matrix client Riot.im when accessed from [https://riot.im](https://riot.im/app), as run by by New Vector Ltd.  It does not apply to other deployments of Riot.

# Our use of cookies and similar technologies

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as local storage and IndexedDB, to support key application functionality and to improve your experience of the application.

## What are cookies and why do we use them?

Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web.

### Cookies for analytics

We use cookies to help us track anonymous usage data - this data helps us understand how our users are using the application so that we can make improvements.

Our analytics are opt-in - if you do not choose to share your anonymous usage data Riot.im will not need to place any cookies on your computer for analytics.

Our analytics are powered by the Free and Open Source analytics platform [Matomo](https://matomo.org/), hosted entirely within our network. We donâ€™t share any analytics data with third parties.

All cookies created by Matomo start with either  _pk_ref, _pk_cvar, _pk_id, or _pk_ses.

### Cookies for security

We use Cloudflare to mitigate the risk of DDoS attacks. Cloudflare uses the __cfduid cookie to identify individual clients behind a shared IP address and apply security settings on a per-client basis.

This cookie is required to support core functionality and so cannot be disabled.

## What are local storage and IndexedDB and why do we use them?

Local storage and IndexedDB are facilities provided by most modern browsers to support storage of application data locally.

Riot.im uses these technologies to store:

* encryption keys required for end-to-end encrypted messaging

* recent message data to provide a rapid Riot.im experience

* configuration data for the app

Use of local storage and IndexedDB is required to support core functionality and so cannot be disabled.
